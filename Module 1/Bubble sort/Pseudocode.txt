1. Start
2. Initialize the array A with n elements.
3. Outer Loop: Iterate i from 0 to n-1.
4. Inner Loop: For each i, iterate j from 0 to n-i-2.
5. Comparison: Compare A[j] with A[j+1].
6. Swap: If A[j] is greater than A[j+1], swap them.
7. Repeat the inner loop until all elements are compared and swapped for the current pass.
8. Repeat the outer loop until all passes are completed.
9. Stop when the array is sorted.
