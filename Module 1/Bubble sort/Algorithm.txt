Step 1: Start

Step 2: Initialize the array A with n elements.

Step 3: Set i = 0 (the outer loop counter).

Step 4: Repeat steps 5 to 10 until i < n-1.

Step 5: Set j = 0 (the inner loop counter).

Step 6: Repeat steps 7 to 9 until j < n-i-1.

Step 7: Compare A[j] and A[j+1].

Step 8: If A[j] is greater than A[j+1], swap A[j] and A[j+1].

Step 9: Increment j by 1 (i.e., j = j + 1).

Step 10: Increment i by 1 (i.e., i = i + 1).

Step 11: Stop (the array A is now sorted).
