Step 1: Start

Step 2: Initialize the array A with n elements.

Step 3: Set a target value x to be searched.

Step 4: Set an index i to 0.

Step 5: Repeat Steps 6 to 9 until i is less than n.

Step 6: If A[i] is equal to x, go to Step 10.

Step 7: Increment i by 1 (i.e., i = i + 1).

Step 8: If i is equal to n, go to Step 11.

Step 9: Repeat from Step 6.

Step 10: Print "Element found at index i."

Step 11: Print "Element not found in the array."

Step 12: Stop
