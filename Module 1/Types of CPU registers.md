## The Central Processing Unit (CPU):
CPU of a computer has many types of registers that serve different purposes:

1. **Accumulator register (AC)**: Used to store the results of logical and arithmetic operations, as well as temporary storage for data during calculations.

2. **Memory address register (MAR)**: Holds the address of the location in memory that needs to be accessed.

3. **Memory data register (MDR)**: Contains the data that will be read from or written to the location specified by the MAR. Together, the MAR and MDR allow the CPU to communicate with the main memory.
4. **Program counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction that needs to be executed after the current one. This register ensures that program instructions are executed in the correct order.
5. **Instruction register**: Stores the instruction that the computer is currently executing.
6. **Memory buffer register (MBR)**: Stores data that is being transferred to and from immediate access storage.
7. **Control register**: Controls or changes the general behavior of the CPU, such as interrupting control, switching addressing modes, and paging control.
