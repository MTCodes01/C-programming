### Operators in C Programming

Operators in C are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables and values). Here are some common types of operators in C:

#### Arithmetic Operators

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Computes the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second.

#### Relational Operators

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

#### Logical Operators

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.

#### Assignment Operator

- **Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

#### Bitwise Operators

- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**, **Bitwise OR (`|`)**, **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**, **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Perform bitwise operations on integers.

These operators are fundamental in C programming for performing various tasks such as arithmetic computations, comparisons, logical operations, and bitwise manipulations.
