## Operators in C Programming

Operators in C are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables and values). Here are some common types of operators in C:

### Arithmetic Operators

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Computes the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second.

### Relational Operators

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

### Logical Operators

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.

### Assignment Operators

- **Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

### Increment and Decrement Operators

- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases the value of the operand by 1.
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases the value of the operand by 1.

### Special Operators

- **Conditional (`?:`)**: Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false.
- **Comma Operator (`comma`)**: Separates expressions in a statement and evaluates them from left to right.
- **Type Cast (`(type)`)**: Converts one data type into another.
- **Sizeof (`sizeof`)**: Returns the size of a variable or data type in bytes.
- **Alignof (`_Alignof`)** (since C11): Returns the alignment requirement of a type.
- **Pointer Operator (`->`)**: Accesses a member of a struct or union through a pointer to them.
